// “Write once, run everywhere”

// Introduction to Java
// Run the code in the text editor to see what is printed to the screen.
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }

// Hello Java File!
// Inside main(), add a statement which prints Hello someName!, with your name replacing someName.
public class HelloYou {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Kyra!");
  }
}

// Commenting Code
// The file Timeline.java has plain text information about Java. Plain text facts aren’t valid syntax. We’ll use comments to avoid breaking the program. Use the single-line comment syntax for the first fact and the multi-line syntax for the second.
public class Timeline {

		created Java while working at Sun Microsystems. 
		His favorite number is the square root of 2! */

// Semicolons and Whitespace
// This file prints information about Java to the screen. Unfortunately, the writer of the file has avoided using whitespace. Make the file easier to read by adding a newline after each statement! Inside main(), add a new statement printing how you feel about coding.

// Java Review: Putting It All Together
// The text editor holds an empty file named Review.java. Fill it in! Define a public class named Review. Define the main() method. Inside the main() method, write "The main method executes the tasks of the class" as a single-line comment. Below the comment, write a statement that prints the following: My first Java program from scratch!.
public class Review{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    // The main method executes the tasks of the class
    System.out.println("My first Java program from scratch!")
  }
}

// Planting a Tree
// Define a class that follows the Java naming conventions. Define the main() method inside of the Tree class. Write a comment to explain the goal then use a print statement to introduce yourself. After introducing yourself, use another print statement to output the project goal! Use multiple print statements to plant your tree.
public class Tree{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    // I'm going to introduce myself and print a tree to the screen.
    System.out.println("My name is Kyra and I'm learning Java!");
